<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The&nbsp; As_Item and Section catalogues are central parts of the
assessment
system. These repositories support reuse of Assessment components by
storing of the various as_items (or questions if you like) and groups
of as_items (ie Sections) that can be used in an assessment. You are
able to
add/edit/delete an as_item of a certain type to a certain scope.
Furthermore it allows you to search and browse for questions for
inclusion in your assesment as well as import and export multiple
questions using various formats.
</p>
<p>In this description here we will only discuss the design
implications for as_items. Green colored tables have to be
internationlized.
</p>
<p>Each as_item consists of a specific as_item Type like "Multiple
Choice
Question" or "Free Text". Each <a href="item_types.html">as_item Type</a>
adds additional Attributes to the as_item, thereby making it pretty
flexible. Additionally each as_item has a related <a
 href="display_types.html">display type</a>
storing information on how to display this as_item. This way we can
create
an adp-snippet which we can include to display a certain as_item (the
snippet is stored de-normalized in the as_items table and update on
every change to the as_item or the as_item_type).<br>
</p>
<p>How is this achieved concretely? Each as_item Type has it's own
table with attributes useful for this as_item type. All tables
(as_items, as_item_type_*, as_item_display_*) are controlled by the
content repository. Each as_item is linked using acs-relationships to
the specific items of the as_item_type_*&nbsp; and as_item_display_*
tables. Each as_item can only be linked to one as_item_type instance
and one as_item_display instance.<br>
</p>
<p>Categorization and internationalization will make it into
OpenACS 5.2, therefore we are not dealing with it in Assessment
seperately but use the (to be) built in functionality of OpenACS 5.2</p>
<p>
Additionally we have support functionality for an as_item. This
includes
the help functionality. To give Assessment authors flexibility in
adapting as_item defaults, help messages, etc for use in different
Assessments, we abstract out a number of attributes from as_as_items
into
mapping tables where "override" values for these attributes can
optionally be set by authors. If they choose not to set overrides, then
the values originally created in the as_item supercede.
</p>
<p>Seperately we will deal with Checks on as_items. These will allow
us to make checks on the input (is the value given by the user actually
a valid value??), branches (if we display this as_item, which responses
have to have been given) and post-input checks (how many points does
this answer give).
</p>
<p>Here is the graphical schema for the as_item-related subsystems,
including the as_item Display subsystem described <a
 style="font-family: monospace;" href="display_types.html">here</a>.<br>

<h2>Core Function: as_items<br>
</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>as_items (as_as_items)</b> are the "questions" that
constitute the
atomic focus of the Assessment package. Each as_item is of a certain
type,
that can give the as_item additional attributes, making it really
flexible. The following attributes are common to all as_item types.
    <ul>
      <li> as_item_id </li>
      <li> cr::name - some phrase used in admin UIs </li>
      <li>cr::title - the primary "label" attached to an as_item's
display </li>
      <li>subtext - a secondary label, needed for many kinds of
questions </li>
      <li> field_code - a short label for use in data output header
rows, etc </li>
      <li> definition - some descriptive text</li>
      <li> required_p - whether as_item must be answered (default
value,
can be overriden)</li>
      <li> data_type - This is the expected data_type of the answer.
Previously "abstract_data_type" but omitting the superfluous "abstract"
term; selected from the data types supported in the RDBMS:
        <ol>
          <li> integer </li>
          <li> numeric </li>
          <li> exponential - stored in the db as a varchar; of form
9.999e99 </li>
          <li> varchar </li>
          <li> text </li>
          <li> date </li>
          <li> boolean (char(1) 't' 'f' in Oracle) </li>
          <li> timestamp (should work for all coarser granularities
like date etc) </li>
          <li> content_type -- a derived type: something in the CR
(instead of a blob type since we use the CR for such things now) </li>
        </ol>
        <font color="red">This value was previously stored with each
as_as_item_type. For retrieval purposes it makes more sense thought to
store it with the as_item itself, as this prevents us to follow each
relationship to the as_as_item_type objects if we want to retrieve the
answer.</font> </li>
      <li> max_time_to_complete - optional max number of seconds to
perform as_item </li>
      <li> adp_chunk - a denormalization to cache the generated
"widget"
for the as_item (NB: when any change is made to an as_as_item_choice
related
to an as_as_item, this will have to be updated!) </li>
    </ul>
    <p> <i>Permissions / Scope</i>: as_items need a clearly defined
scope, in
which they can be reused. Instead of defining a special scope variable
we will use the acs permission system to grant access rights to an
as_item. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Read: An assessment author (who is granted this permission)
can
reuse this as_item in one of his sections. (NB: Usually the original
author has admin priviledges.). This is a finer granulation than the
previous "enabled_p" as it allows specific access to an item. </li>
      <li>Write: Author can reuse and change this as_item. </li>
      <li>Admin: Author can reuse, change and give permission on this
as_item</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
  </li>
</ul>

Types (as_item_type_*)</font></b>
define types of as_items like "Open Question", "Calculation" and
others.
The as_item type will also define in what format the answer should be
stored. For <span style="font-weight: bold;">each</span> as_item type
a cr_as_item_type will be generated. Each
object of this type is linked to the primary object of the as_item (see
above) using relationships. This has the benefit that we split the core
attributes of an as_item from the type specific ones and the display
ones
(see down below). Using cr_as_item_type usage allows us to create and
reuse standard as_items (e.g. for the likert scale), by linking
different
questions with the answer possibilities (and the same attributes) to
one as_as_item_type object. If we have objects that are linked this
way,
we can generate the matrix for them easily. </span></span>A functional
list of all as_item types and their attributes can be

<ul>
  <li><b><font color="green">Multiple Choices (as_as_item_choices)</font></b>
contain additional information for all multiple choice as_item_types.
Obvious examples are radiobutton and checkbox as_items, but
pop-up_date,
typed_date and image_map as_items also are constructed via as_item
Choices.
Each choice is a child to an as_as_item_type Object. Note the
difference.
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">A choice does not belong to an
as_item, but to the instance of the
as_item_type! </span>This way we can reuse multiple choice answers
easier. It
is
debatable if we should allow n:m relationships between choices and
as_item_types (thereby allowing the same choice been reused). In my
opinion this is not necessary, therefore we have the parent_id.
Following the Lars Skinny Table approach of conflating all the
different potential data types into one table, we provide columns to
hold values of the different types and another field to determine which
of them is used. as_item Choices have these attributes:
    <ul>
      <li> choice_id </li>
      <li> parent_id (belonging to an as_as_item_<b>type</b>
object).</li>
      <li>table_name - To which table (eg. as_item_type_mc or
as_item_type_im) does this choice belong to.<br>
      </li>
      <li> cr::name - Identifier<br>
      </li>
      <li> cr::titel - what is displayed in the choice's "label" </li>
      <li> data_type - which of the value columns has the information
this Choice conveys </li>
      <li> numeric_value - we can stuff both integers and real numbers
here <br>
      </li>
      <li>text_value </li>
      <li> boolean_value </li>
      <li> content_value - references an as_item in the CR -- for an
image, audio file, or video file </li>
      <li>feedback_text - where optionally some preset feedback can be
specified by the author</li>
      <li>selected_p - Is this choice selected by default (when the
item is presented to the user)<br>
      </li>
      <li>score - Score given to the user if this choice is selected
(in percent). <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>NB: In earlier versions (surveys/questionnaire), each Choice
definition carried with it any range-checking or text-filtering
criteria; these are now abstracted to the as_item-Checks and
Inter-as_item
Checks.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Item Display Types</h2>
Each item has an item_display_type object associated with it, that
defines how to display the item. Each item_display_type has a couple of
attributes, that can be passed to the formbuilder for the creation of
the widget. Each widget has at least one item_display_type associated
with it. In the long run I think this system has the potential to
become a part of OpenACS itself (storing additional display information
for each acs_object), but we are not there yet :). Obviouslly we are
talking cr_item_types here as well.
<p>Each item_display_type has a couple of attributes in common.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>item_display_id </li>
  <li>cr::name - name like "Select box, aligned right", stored in the
name field of CR.<br>
  </li>
  <li>acs_widget - the type of "widget" displayed when the
Item is output in html. There are many types we should support beyond
the stock html types. We are talking <a
 href="../../../acs-templating/www/doc/widgets/index.html">ACS
Templating widgets</a> here.<br>
  </li>
  <li> item_answer_alignment - the orientation between the
"question part" of the Item (the item_text/item_subtext) and the
"answer part" -- the native Item widget (eg the textbox) or the 1..n
choices. Alternatives accommodate L-&gt;R and R-&gt;L alphabets (or is
this handled automagically be Internationalization?) and include:
    <ol>
      <li> beside_left - the "answers" are left of the "question" </li>
      <li> beside_right - the "answers" are right of the "question" </li>
      <li> below - the "answers" are below the "question" </li>
      <li> above - the "answers" are above the "question" </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li> html_display_options - field to specify other stuff like
textarea dimensions ("rows=10 cols=50" eg)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Depending on the presentation_types <font color="red">additonal
attributes (presentation_type attributes)</font>
come into play (are added as attributes to the CR item type) (mark:
this is not feature complete. It really is up to the coder to decide
what attributes each widget should have, down here are only
*suggestions*). Additionally we're not mentioning all HTML
possibilities associated with each type (e.g. a textarea has width and
heigth..) as these can be parsed in via the html_display_options.<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li> textbox - single-line typed entry
    <ul>
      <li> abs_size - An abstraction of the real size value in
"small","medium","large". Up to the developer how this translates. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> text area - multiple-line typed entry
    <ul>
      <li> abs_size - An abstraction of the real size value in
"small","medium","large". Up to the developer how this translates. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> radiobutton (as_item_display_rb) - single-choice multiple-option
    <ul>
      <li> choice_orientation - the pattern by which 2..n Item Choices
are
laid out when displayed. Note that this isn't a purely stylistic issue
better left to the .adp templates or css; the patterns have semantic
implications that the Assessment author appropriately should control
here. Note also that Items with no Choices (eg a simple textbox Item)
has no choice_orientation, but handles the location of that textbox
relative to the Item label by the item_alignment option (discussed
below).
        <ol>
          <li> horizontal - all Choices are in one line </li>
          <li> vertical - all Choices are in one column </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>choice_label_orientation - how shall the label be positioned
in relation to the choice (top, left, right, buttom).<br>
      </li>
      <li>button_type - type of button to use</li>
      <li>sort_order: Numerical, alphabetic, randomized or
by order of entry (sort_order field). </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> checkbox - multiple-choice multiple-option
    <ul>
      <li> choice_orientation (see above)</li>
      <li>choice_label_orientation<br>
      </li>
      <li>allow_multiple_p - Is it allow to select multiple values ?</li>
      <li>sort_order: Numerical, alphabetic, randomized or
by order of entry (sort_order field). </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> select (as_item_display_sb) - multiple-option displayed in
"popup menu" (select box)<br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>sort_order: Numerical, alphabetic, randomized or
by order of entry (sort_order field).</li>
    <li><span class="context"><span class="reg">allow_multiple_p - Is
it allow to select multiple values ?</span></span></li>
  </ul>
  <li> multiple-choice-other: Consider, for instance, a combo box
that consists of a radiobutton plus a textbox -- used for instance when
you need a check "other" and then fill in what that "other" datum is.
In effect this is a single Item but it has two different forms: a
radiobutton and a textbox.
    <ul>
      <li> other_size: size of the other text field. </li>
      <li> other_label: label (instead of "other"). </li>
      <li> display_type: What display type should be used for the
multiple-choice-part ? </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> pop-up_date - a widget with month-day-year select elements
that resets the day element based on year and month (ie include Feb 29
during leap years -- via Javascript) and tests for valid dates </li>
  <li> typed_date - similar to pop-up_date but month-day-year
elements are textboxes for all-keyboard entry; needs no resetting
scripts but does need date validity check </li>
  <li> image_map - requires a linked image; the image map coordinates
are handled as Item Choices </li>
  <li> file_upload - present a File box (browse button, file_name
textbox, and submit button together) so user can upload a file </li>
</ul>
</span></span><span class="context"><span class="reg">
<h2>Help System</h2>
The help system should allow a small "?" appear
next to an object's title that has a help text identified with it. Help
texts are to be displayed in the nice bar that Lars created for OpenACS
in the header. Each object can have multiple help texts associated with
it (which will be displayed in sort order with each hit to the "?".)
and we can reuse the help text, making this an n:m relationship (using
cr_rels). E.g. you might want to have a default help text for certain
cr_as_item_types, that's why I was thinking about reuse...
<p>Relationship attributes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> as_item_id </li>
  <li> message_id - references as_messages </li>
  <li> sort_order (in which order do the messages appear) </li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Messages (as_messages)</b> abstracts out help messages (and other
types of messages) for use in this package. Attributes include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> message_id </li>
  <li> message </li>
  <li> locale (Actually I hope the i18n system Joel proposed makes this
obsolete). </li>
</ul>
