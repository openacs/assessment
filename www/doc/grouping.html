<h2>Review of Specific Entities</h2>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Assessments (as_assessments) are the highest-level
container in the hierarchical structure. They define the key by which
all other entities are assembled into meaningful order during display,
processing, retrieval and display of Assessment information.
    <p>The primary key assessment_id is a revision_id inherited from
cr_revisions. Note, the CR provides two main types of entities --
cr_items and cr_revisions. The latter are where sequential versions of
the former go, while cr_items is where the "current" version of an
entity can be stored, where unchanging elements of an entity are kept,
or where data can be cached. This is particularly useful if the system
needs a single "live" version, but it isn't appropriate in situations
where all versions potentially are equally-important siblings. In the
case of the Assessment package, it seems likely that in some
applications, users would indeed want to designate a single "live"
version, while in many others, they wouldn't.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Attributes of Assessments will include those previously included
in Surveys plus some others: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> assessment_id </li>
      <li> cr:name - a curt name appropriate for URLs <br>
      </li>
      <li>cr:title - a formal title to use in page layouts etc </li>
      <li>creator_id - Who is the "main" author and creator of this
assessment </li>
      <li>cr:description - text that can appear in introductory web
pages </li>
      <li> instructions - text that explains any specific steps the
subject needs to follow </li>
      <li>mode - whether this is a standalone assessment (like current
surveys), or if it provides an "assessment service" to another OpenACS
app, or a "web service" via SOAP etc </li>
      <li>editable_p - whether the response to the assessment is
editable once an item has been responded to by the user. </li>
      <li><span class="context"><span class="reg">anonymous_p - This
shows whether the creator of the accessment will have
the possibility to see the personal details of the respondee or not. In
particular this will exclude the user_id from the CSV files. It shall
still be possible to see the user that have not finished the survey
though.</span></span></li>
      <li><span class="context"><span class="reg">secure_access_p - The
assessment can only be taken if a secure connection (https) is used.</span></span></li>
      <li><span class="context"><span class="reg">reuse_responses_p -
If
yes, the system will look for previous responses to the questions and prefill the last answer the respondee has given in
the assessment form of the respondee</span></span></li>
      <li><span class="context"><span class="reg">show_item_name_p - If
yes, the respondee will see the name of the item in
addition to the item itself when taking the survey.</span></span></li>
      <li>entry_page - The customizable entry page that will be
displayed before the first response.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>exit_page - Customizable exit / thank you page that will be
displayed once the assessment has been responded.</li>
      <li>consent_page - <br>
      </li>
      <li>return_url - URL the respondee will be redirected to
after finishing the assessment. Should be redirected directly if no
Thank you page is there. Otherwise the return_url should be set in the
thank you page context, so we can have a "continue" URL.</li>
      <li>start_time - At what time shall the assessment become
available to the users (remark: It will only become available to the
users who have at least the "respond" privilege.</li>
      <li>end_time - At what time the assessment becomes unavailable.
This is a hard date, any response given after this time will be
discarded.</li>
      <li>number_tries - Number of times a respondee can answer the
assessment</li>
      <li>wait_between_tries - Number of minutes a respondee has to
wait before he can retake the assessment.</li>
      <li>time_for_response - How many minutes has the respondee to
finish the assessment (taken from the start_time in as_sessions).</li>
      <li>show_feedback - Which feedback_text stored with the item_type
shall be displayed to the respondee (All, none, correct, incorrect).
Correct and Incorrect will only show the feedback_text if the response
was correct or incorrect.</li>
      <li><span class="context"><span class="reg"><span class="reg">section_navigation
- How shall the navigation happen <br>
        </span></span></span></li>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="context"><span class="reg"><span class="reg">default
path - Order given by the relationship between assessment and section
(the order value in cr_rels, if this is used).<br>
          </span></span></span></li>
        <li><span class="context"><span class="reg"><span class="reg">randomized
- Sections will be displayed randomly</span></span></span></li>
        <li><span class="context"><span class="reg"><span class="reg">rule-based
branching - Sections will be displayed according to inter-item-checks.
This should be default.</span></span></span></li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Style Options (as_assessment_styles): Each assessment has a
special style associated with it. As styles can be reused (e.g. within
a department) they are covered in the as_assessment_styles:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>custom_header - Custom header (and footer)
that
will be displayed to the respondee when answering an assessment.
Possibility to include system variables (e.g. first name). <br>
    </li>
    <li>custom_footer<br>
    </li>
    <li>form_template - Style (form_template) that will be
used for this assessment. You can either select an existing one or
upload a new style as well as edit the currently chosen one (no
datamodell but UI thought). <br>
    </li>
    <li><span class="context"><span class="reg">progress_bar: What
kind of progress bar shall be
displayed to the respondee while taking the assessment </span></span><span
 class="context"><span class="reg">(no
progress bar, different styles).</span></span></li>
    <li><span class="context"><span class="reg">presentation_style:
These
options allow the respondee to select between different presentation
styles. At least one of the checkboxes mentioned below has to be
selected.
      <ul>
        <li>All questions at once </li>
        <li>One question per page. If you have selected respondee may
not
edit their responses, it will not be possible for them to go back and
choose another answer to that question. </li>
        <li>Sectioned </li>
      </ul>
      </span></span></li>
    <><span class="context"><span class="reg"></span></span></>
  </ul>
  <p>Permissions / Scope: Control of reuse previously was through a
shareable_p boolean. As with Items and Sections, we instead will use
the acs permission system: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Read: An assessment author (who is granted this permission)
can
reuse this assessment (NB: Usually the original author has admin
privileges.) </li>
    <li>Write: Author can reuse and change this assessment. </li>
    <li>Admin: Author can reuse, change and give permission on this
assessment</li>
    <li>Respond: The user can respond to the survey.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <li> Sections (as_sections) represent logically-grouped
set of Items that always need to be present or absent together in the
Assessment. Sections thus divide at logical branch points. These branch
points are configured during Assessment creation to determine movement
among Sections based on one of various mechanisms: pre-set criteria
specified by the Assessment author, or criteria based on user-submitted
data up to the point of branching. Note that Items within a single
Section may be presented one-by-one in different pages; pagination is
thus related but not equivalent to Section definitions and in fact is
an attribute of a Section. Well, more accurately, of a Section Display
Type (see below). Attributes of Sections themselves include</li>
  <li>e:
    <ul>
      <li> section_id </li>
      <li> section_display_type_id - references
as_section_display_types </li>
      <li> name - used for page display </li>
      <li> definition - text used for identification and selection in
admin pages, not for end-user pages </li>
      <li> instructions - text displayed on user pages </li>
      <li> enabled_p - good to go? </li>
      <li> required_p - probably not as useful as per-Item required_p
but maybe worth having here; what should it mean, though? All Items in
a required section need to be required? At least one? Maybe this isn't
really useful. </li>
      <li> content_value - references cr_revisions: for an image, audio
file or video file </li>
      <li> numeric_value - optional "number of points" for section </li>
      <li> feedback_text - optional preset text to show user </li>
      <li> max_time_to_complete - optional max number of seconds to
perform Section </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Permissions / Scope: Control of reuse previously was through a
shareable_p boolean. As with Items and Assessments, we instead will use
the acs permission system: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Read: A section author (who is granted this permission) can
reuse
this section (NB: Usually the original author has admin privileges.) </li>
      <li>Write: Author can reuse and change this section. </li>
      <li>Admin: Author can reuse, change and give permission on this
section </li>
    </ul>
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li> Section Display Types (as_section_display_types)
define types of display for an groups of Items. Examples are a
"compound question" such as "What is your height" where the response
needs to include a textbox for "feet" and one for "inches". Other
examples are "grids" of radiobutton multiple-choice Items in which each
row is another Item and each column is a shared radiobutton, with the
labels for the radiobutton options only displayed at the top of the
grid (see <a href="http://www.epimetrics.com/demos">the SAQ</a> for an
illustration of this).
    <p>This entity is directly analogous in purpose and design to
as_item_display_types. </p>
    <ul>
      <li> section_display_type_id </li>
      <li> section_type_name - name like "Vertical Column" or
"Depth-first Grid" or "Combo Box" </li>
      <li> pagination_style - all-items; one-item-per-page; variable
(get item groups from mapping table) </li>
      <li> branched_p - whether this Section defines a branch point (so
that the navigation procs should look for the next step) or whether
this Section simply transitions to the next Section in the sort_order
(it may be better not to use this denormalization and instead always
look into the Sequencing mechanism for navigation -- we're still fuzzy
on this) </li>
      <li> item_orientation - the pattern by which 2..n Items are laid
out when displayed. Note that this isn't a purely stylistic issue
better left to the .adp templates or css; the patterns have semantic
implications that the Assessment author appropriately should control
here.
        <ol>
          <li> horizontal - all Items are in one line </li>
          <li> vertical - all Items are in one column </li>
          <li> matrix_col-row - Items are laid out in matrix, filling
first col then row </li>
          <li> matrix_row-col -Items are laid out in matrix, filling
first row then col </li>
        </ol>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li> item_labels_as headers_p - whether to display labels of
the Items; if not, a "grid of radiobuttons" gets displayed. See
discussion of Items and Item Choices <a
 href="http://openacs.org/projects/openacs/packages/assessment/design/as_items">here</a>.
There are contexts where a Section of Items all share the same Choices
and should be laid out with the Items' item_subtexts as row headers and
the radiobuttons (or checkboxes) only -- without their labels --
displayed in a grid (see <a
 href="http://www.cvoutcomes.org/questionnaires/one-questionnaire?questionnaire_id=5">this
example</a>). </li>
      <li> presentation_type - may actually be superfluous...gotta
think more about this, but there's at least one example:
        <ol>
          <li> ranking - a set of alternatives each need to be assigned
an
exclusive rank ("Indicate the order of US Presidents from bad to
worse"). Is this one Item with multiple Item Choices? Actually, not,
since each alternative has a value that must be separately stored (the
tester would want to know that the testee ranked GWB last, for
instance). </li>
          <li> what others? </li>
        </ol>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li> item_alignment - the orientation between the "section
description part" of the Section (if any) and the group of Items.
Alternatives accommodate L-&gt;R and R-&gt;L alphabets (or is this
handled automagically be Internationalization?) and include:
        <ol>
          <li> beside_left - the Items are left of the "heading" </li>
          <li> beside_right - the Items are right of the "heading" </li>
          <li> below - the Items are below the "heading" </li>
          <li> above - the Items are above the "heading" </li>
        </ol>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li> display_options - field to specify other stuff like the grid
dimensions ("rows=10 cols=50" eg) </li>
    </ul>
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li> Item Section map (as_item_section_map) defines 1..n Items to a
Section, caches display code, and contains optional overrides for
Section and Item attributes:
    <ul>
      <li> item_id </li>
      <li> section_id </li>
      <li> enabled_p </li>
      <li> required_p - whether Item must be answered </li>
      <li> item_default </li>
      <li> content_value - references CR </li>
      <li> numeric_value - where optionally the "points" for the Item
can be stored </li>
      <li> feedback_text </li>
      <li> max_time_to_complete </li>
      <li> adp_chunk - display code </li>
      <li> sort_order </li>
    </ul>
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li> Section Assessment Map (as_assessment_section_map) basically is
a standard map, though we can override a few Section attributes here if
desired:
    <ul>
      <li> assessment_id </li>
      <li> section_id </li>
      <li> feedback_text </li>
      <li> max_time_to_complete </li>
      <li> sort_order </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
