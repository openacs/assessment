<h2>Policies and Events<br>
</h2>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Assessment-Policies (as_assessment_policies) abstract out
from Assessments a variety of attributes that describe deployment
particulars. This allows multiple users of an Assessment to define
beginning and ending dates, eg:
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li> policy_id
      </li>
      <li> policy_name
      </li>
      <li> start_date
      </li>
      <li> end_date
      </li>
      <li> anonymous_p - whether anonymous subjects are allowed
      </li>
      <li> repetition_interval_granularity - minutes, hours, days
      </li>
      <li> repetition_interval - an integer that (along with the
granularity) defines the minimum interval between sequential
assessments by a subject; an interval of zero means that only a single
time through is allowed
      </li>
      <li> editable_p - whether user can alter submitted responses
      </li>
      <li> max_edits_allowed - optional max number of times subject can
change responses
      </li>
      <li> max_time_to_complete - optional max number of seconds to
perform Assessment
      </li>
      <li> interruptable_p - whether user can "save&amp;resume" session
      </li>
      <li> data_entry_mode - (presumes that the necessary UI output
procs are implemented in the APIs) to produce different deployment
formats: standard web page, handheld gizmo, kiosk "one question at a
time", AVR over phone, etc etc
      </li>
      <li> consent_required_p - whether subjects must give formal
consent before doing Assessment
      </li>
      <li> consent - optional text to which the subject needs to agree
before doing the Assessment (this may be more appropriate to abstract
to Assessment-Events)
      </li>
      <li> logo - optional graphic that can appear on each page
      </li>
      <li> electronic_signature_p - whether subject must check
"attestation box" and provide password to "sign"
      </li>
      <li> digital_signature_p - whether in addition to the electronic
signature, the response must be hashed and encrypted
      </li>
      <li> shareable_p - whether Policy is shareable; defaults to 't'
since this is the whole intent of this "repository" approach, but
authors' should have option to prevent reuse
      </li>
      <li> feedback_text - where optionally some preset feedback can be
specified by the author
      </li>
      <li> double_entry_p - do two staff need to enter data before it's
accepted?
      </li>
      <li> require_annotations_with_rev_p - is an annotation required
if a user modifies a submitted response?
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li> Assessment Events (as_assessment_events) define an
planned, scheduled or intended "data collection event". It abstracts
out from Assessment Policies details that define specific instances of
an Assessment's deployment. Attributes include:
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li> event_id
      </li>
      <li> name
      </li>
      <li> description
      </li>
      <li> instructions
      </li>
      <li> target_days_post_enroll - an interval after the "enrollment"
date which could be the time a subject is enrolled in a trial or the
beginning of a term
      </li>
      <li> optimal_days_pre - along with the next attribute, defines a
range of dates when the Assessment should be performed (if zero, then
the date must be exact)
      </li>
      <li> optimal_days_post
      </li>
      <li> required_days_pre - as above, only the range within which
the Assessment must be performed
      </li>
      <li> required_days_post</li>
      <li style="font-family: monospace;">

        </p>
        </center>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
