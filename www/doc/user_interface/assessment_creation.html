When creating an assessment the administrator has a couple of fields to
determine the look and feel of the assessment along with the option to
view the responses. This is a list of attributes the administrator can
edit when creating an assessment. The grouping is based on the UI and
not on the datamodell. So you should follow this with regards to the
UI:
<ul>
  <li>Title: Title of the accessment
  </li>
  <li>Anonymous Accessment: boolean (yes/no). This shows whether the
creator of the accessment will have the possibility to see the personal
details of the respondee or not. In particular this will exclude the
user_id from the CSV files. It shall still be possible to see the user
that have not finished the survey though.
  </li>
  <li>Secure access only: boolean (yes/no). The assessment can only be
taken if a secure connection (https) is used.
  </li>
  <li>Presentation Options: These options allow the respondee to select
between different presentation styles. At least one of the checkboxes
mentioned below has to be selected.
    <ul>
      <li>All questions at once
      </li>
      <li>One question per page. If you have selected respondee may not
edit their responses, it will not be possible for them to go back and
choose another answer to that question.
      </li>
      <li>Sectioned
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Reuse responses: boolean (yes/no). If yes, the system will look
for previous responses to the questions and prefill the last answer
the respondee has given in the assessment form of the respondee. <em>It
is debatable whether this function should be per assessment and/or per
question</em>
  </li>
  <li><span class="reg"><li>Navigation of sections: select (default
path, randomized, rule-based branching, maybe looping in the future).</li>
    <li><span class="context"></span>Show question titles: boolean
(yes/no). If yes, the respondee will see the title of the question in
addition to the question itself when taking the survey.</li>
    <li>Consent Pages: richtext. <span class="context"><span
 class="reg"><span class="context">An
assessment author should be able optionally to specify some consent
statement that a user must agree to in order to proceed with the
assessment. The datamodel needs to store the user's response positive
response with a timestamp (in as_sessions). This isn't relevant in
educational testing, but it is an important feature to include for
other settings, notably medical and financial ones. <br>
      </span></span></span></li>
    </span></li>
  <li>Progress bar: select. (no progress bar, different styles). What
kind of progress bar shall be displayed to the respondee while taking
the assessment.
  </li>
  <li>Styles
    <ul>
      <li>Custom header / footer: richtext. Custom header and footer
that will be displayed to the respondee when answering an assessment.
Possibility to include system variables (e.g. first name).
      </li>
      <li>Select presentation style. Style (form_template) that will be
used for this assessment
      </li>
      <li>Upload new: file. Possibility to upload a new style
      </li>
      <li>Edit (brings up a page with the possibility to edit the
selected style)
      </li>
      <li>Customizable Entry page: richtext. The page that will be
displayed before the first response.
      </li>
      <li>Customizable buttons for Submit, Save, continue, cancel (e.g.
using the style?)
      </li>
      <li>Customizable thank you page: richtext.
      </li>
      <li>Return_URL: text. URL the respondee will be redirected to
after finishing the assessment. Should be redirected directly if no
Thank you page is there. Otherwise the return_url should be set in the
thank you page context, so we can have a "continue" URL.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Times
    <ul>
      <li>Availability: 2 date widgets (from, and to). This will set the
time the time the survey will become visible for the respondees. It is
overridden by the parameter enabled (if a accessment is not enabled, it
will never be visible, regardless of date).
      </li>
      <li>How often can a accessment be taken: Number of times a survey
can be taken by a respondee.
      </li>
      <li>How long has a user to pause: Number of hours a respondee has
to wait before he can take the accessment again.
      </li>
      <li>Answer_time: integer: Time in minutes a respondee has to
answer a survey.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Show comments to the user
    <ul>
      <li>No comments: the user will not see the comments stored with
the questions at all
      </li>
      <li>All comments: the user will see all the comments associated
with his answers to the questions
      </li>
      <li>Only wrong comments: the user will only see the comments to
questions which he answered in correctly.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Permissions
    <ul>
      <li>Grant explicit permissions: Link to a separate page that will
allow the creator to grant and revoke permission for this survey.
Permissions are (take_survey, administer_survey)
      </li>
      <li>Grant permission on status in curriculum. Needs to be exactly
defined. Otherwise we will write a small page, that allows the admin to
select exams and a minimum point number the student has to have
achieved in that exam.
      </li>
      <li>Bulk upload: file. Upload a CSV file with email addresses to
allow access to the accessment. Add users to the system if not already
part of it. Notify users via email that they should take the
accessment. </li>
      <li>Password: short_text. Password that has to be typed in before
the respondee get's access to the accessment. This should be done by
creating a registered filter that returns a 401 to popup an HTTP auth
box. look in oacs_dav::authenticate for an example of how to check the
username/password<br>
      </li>
      <li>IP Netmask. short_text. Netmask that will be matched against
the IP-Address of the respondee. If it does not match, the user will not
be given access. Again this should be handled by the creation of a
registered filter on the URL where the assessment resides (for the
respondee that is, meaning the entry URL for responding to the
assessment).<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Notifications
    <ul>
      <li>Notifications will be done using the notification system of
OpenACS.<br>
      </li>
      <li>For all notifications allow system variables should be used.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>System_name</li>
        <li>User_name</li>
        <li>user_id</li>

      <li>Links to spam the following group of people (information can
be taken out of as_sessions):</li>
