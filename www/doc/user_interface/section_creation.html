Section page. This page is for editing information about a section and
adding questions to it. It contains a couple of subpages. Datamodell
can be found <a href="http://sussdorff.de/assessment/doc/grouping.html">here.</a><br>
<br>
On the Top of the page display the title and description along with the
display type for information purposes. Below this put links to the
following pages.<br>
<br>
The section edit page contains the following Items:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Title: Title of the section</li>
  <li>Description: text used for identification and selection in admin
pages, not for end-user pages</li>
  <li>Instructions: text displayed on user pages describing the user
how to fill out the section.</li>
  <li><a href="../display_types.html#section_display">Display Type</a>:
section display type to use. Select box of display types in use by this
user, as well as "new display type" and "display type from catalogue".<br>
  </li>
  <li><span class="reg"><li>Seconds allowed for completion: integer.
Seconds allowed for completing the section.</li>
    <li>Feedback Text: textarea. Feedback given to the user after
finishing the section.</li>
    <li><span class="context"><span class="reg">Number of questions:
Number of questions that will be displayed
in this section. Only useful if we randomize.</span></span> If the
number of questions added to this section is higher than number of
questions to display then we randomly pick from the questions, but
definitely add the mandatory questions.<br>
    </li>
    <br>
    </span></li>
</ul>
The branch conditions page allows the conditions to be added under
which this section will be called (branch conditions). This is still
work in progress and will not be developed in the first phase.</span></span><br>

this section)</li>

<ul>
  <li style="color: rgb(204, 102, 0);">Branch by question. This kind of
branch depends on previous
answers. A table of all multiple choice / boolean questions will be
given to the creator along with their possible answers.
    <ul>
      <li>Each question has a checkbox to determine if this question
shall be included in this branch condition and a radio button, if all
answers or just one have to be given (e.g. if we have multiple correct
answers, we might want to branch into this section all answers have
been selected by the respondee or just one). </li>
      <li>The answers have checkboxes, with the correct answers checked
by default for multiple choice question. All other questions will only
be displayed if they give a percentage value to the answer. In this
case a textfield is given with the possibility to give a range (10-100)
or separate percentages (10, 100, 200). </li>
      <li>The display of this section depends on whether the valid
answers have been given to all or just one of the questions that have
been checked (as you might have guessed, we need a radio button for
this below the table). </li>
    </ul>
Questions that will be displayed depend on the position of the section.
Only questions that could have been answered in the assessment before
this section is displayed will be shown. </li>
  <li style="color: rgb(204, 102, 0);">Branch by result. Instead of
relying on one or multiple answers
we check for a result in a previous section. This can only work in a
test environment (so don't display this option if we are not dealing
with a test).
    <ul>
      <li>Section: select. This will display a list of all previous
sections. The selected section will be used for the computation. </li>
      <li>Calculation: select (median, distractor, absolute number of
points). What shall be computed to determine whether the user is
allowed to see this section. </li>
      <li>From / To value: integer. Two fields to display the valid
range for which this section will be displayed to the user. </li>
    </ul>

combination of both methods makes sense,
so we should take this into account when creating the UI.</span> </li>
