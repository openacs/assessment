<h1>Introduction</h1>
In recent times the survey system has expanded beyond it's initial
scope of providing a quick and easy solution to conduct surveys. Due to
it's flexibility it has already expanded in the area of storing user
information and provide a tool for feedback for quality assurance.
<p>On the other hand the need for dotLRN has risen to provide an
assessment solutions that allows (automated) tests as well with the
possibility to score the test results and store them in an easy
retrievable way.</p>
<p>Last but not least a new demand has risen for the possibility to
give and store ratings on objects within the system as part of a
knowledge management solution.</p>
<p>The documents on these page will provide a solution that is flexible
to meet ababove needs but still be focused enought to apply for special
clients demands.
</p>
<h1>Assessments</h1>
The current survey system will build the basis for a new assessment
package and will consist of various areas:
<h2>Question Catalogue</h2>
The question catalogue stores all the questions of the assesment
package. It is a pool where all the questions from all assessments are
stored in. This creates the opportunity to make the questions reusable,
allowing for statistics across surveys and prevents the respondee from
having to fill out a question he has already filled out. Furthermore
special administrators are given the possibility to add questions that
do not store the results within the scope of the assessment package but
in other database tables (e.g. the name of the user) or trigger some
other events (e.g. send email to the email address filled out by the
respondee). A detailed description can be found <a
 href="question_catalogue">here</a>.
<h2>Assessment creation</h2>
An assessment is either a survey or a test. The functionality for both
is nearly identical though a test needs additional work to allow for
automated grading. A detailed description of the options given to the
creator of an assessment can be found <a href="assessment_creation">here.</a>
<p>Each assessment consists of various sections, that allow for the
split up of the assessment (so it will be displayed to the respondee on
multiple pages) and give the possibility for branching depending on
previous answers of the respondee. Questions are always added into the
question database first, then added to a specific section and thus made
available to the assessment. A detailed description of the Sections can
be found <a href="sections">here</a>.
</p>
<h2>Tests</h2>
Tests are a special kind of assessment in that they allow for automatic
processing of the answers and storage of the result in the grading
system. They have a couple of additional settings as well as the
possibility to get an overview of the evaluation (what have the
respondees answered, how have they done in total (points)). A
description for this can be found <a href="tests">here</a>.
<p>The backend for the test processing, that enables the automatic
tests is described in a <a href="test_processing">seperate document</a>
as it will be parsed while the respondee answers the test, not
manually. In addition this document describes how the grades are
calculated (automatically or manually) for each question. The result is
beeing stored in the grading package.
</p>
<h1>Scoring/Grading</h1>
The grading package will be designed first of all to all the storing of
test results. In addition to this, it will provide functionality to
other packages to allow rating of their contents (one example of this
would be Lars Rating package, that would be used as a basis for this).
In general it should provide a very flexible way of adding scores into
the system, either automatically (as described above) or manually (e.g.
this student did a good oral exam).
<p>In addition to the possiblity to enter scores/rates, the grading
package allows for automatic aggregation of scores. This holds
especially true for tests and classes. A test result will depend on the
result of all the answers (aggregated). A class result will depend on
the result of all the tests a respondee did in addition to any manual
grades the professor can come up with. Providing a clean UI for this is
going to be the challange.</p>
<p>Furthermore the grading package offers to transfer scores (which are
stored as integer values) into a grade (e.g. the american A-F scheme,
or the German 1-6). This is where it gets the name from I'd say ;).
Grading schemes are flexible and can be created on the fly. This allows
us to support any grading scheme across the world's universities. In
addition in the area of Knowledge Management, grades could be
transfered into incentive points, that can be reused to reward
employees for good work done (where they got good ratings for).</p>
<p>Last but not least, maybe embeded with the workflow system, is the
possibility to execute actions based on the grade. An example would be
the adding of the student to the advanced class if his grade or score
reaches a certain level. Alternatively this looks like a good thing for
the curriculum module to achieve.
</p>
<h1>User Experience</h1>
So far we have only talked about the administrators point of view. A
respondee will be directed to an assessment from various possible entry
points. Depending on the settings for the assessment the respondee will
be presented with the assessment that he is allowed to answer. Though a
lot of it is redundant, a <a href="user_experience">special page</a>
has been created to describe this. For the implementation though there
might be additional things depending on the specifications of the
various administrator settings.
<h1>Use Cases</h1>
The most obvious use case would be a class in a school or university,
that offers automated tests to the students and wants to have them
graded automatically. The description of the assessment system has been
written mainly with this in mind.
<p>Additionally you can use the assessment system to collect user
information. When signing up to a site the user could be asked to fill
out an assessment where part of the questions will be stored in the
acs_users table, some other questions in other tables and the rest in
the accessment package. This way a quick view can be given about the
user (aggregating user information in a flexible way). Best explanation
would be to treat the /pvt/home page as a collection of assessment data
and the "change basic information" as one assessment among many.</p>
<p>With a little bit of tweaking and the possiblity to add instant
gratification, aka aggregated result display, it could include the poll
package and make it redundant.</p>
<p>Last but not least with the ability to display questions in a multi
dimensional way to the user, the assessment system is usefull for
quality assurance (how important is this feature / how good do you
think we implemented it). And as you might have guessed, for anything
the current survey module has been used for as well (e.g. plain and
simple surveys).
</p>
<p>The grading system on it's own would be usefull for the OpenACS
community as it would allow the handing out of "zorkmints" along with
any benefits the collection of mints gives to the users. As mentioned
earlier, this is also very important in a Knowledge Management
environment, where you want to give rated feedback to users.
