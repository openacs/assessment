User experience describes the various steps the USER sees and what he
can do when taking an assessment. When answering a section a couple of
things happen:
<ul>
  <li>A permission check will be made to determine whether the user is
allowed to take the assessment.
    <ul>
      <li>Is the user allowed to take the survey at all (acs_permission
check)
      </li>
      <li>Are all conditions for the taking of the assessment
fullfilled
      </li>
      <li>Is there still a try for the user left
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Starttime of the response will be logged
  </li>
  <li>First section will be delivered to the user for anwering.
  </li>
</ul>
Depending on the settings, the display of the assessment will vary:
<ul>
  <li>If all answers have to be submited seperatly, a submit button
will be shown next to each answer. If the user hits the submit button
next to the question the answer will be stored in the response.
  </li>
  <li>Else the normal section view will be displayed with a submit
button at the end of the section.
  </li>
  <li>If the user can change the results of a question, the submitted
question will be displayed with an edit instead of the submit button.
Otherwise only the answer will be displayed. In either case the answer
is displayed as text on the page, not within a form element.
  </li>
  <li>If the respondee cannot see his old answers, don't display them
once submitted. Make sure the backbutton does not work (e.g. using
Postdata ?). Not sure how much sense it makes to display an edit button
:).
  </li>
  <li>If we have a time in which the respondee has to answer the
assessment, display a bar with time left.
  </li>
  <li>If we have to show a progress bar, show it and renew it after
each submit (so also for each question).
  </li>
  <li>Display a finish test button at the end of the page to "hand the
test to the TA" if this is allowed
  </li>
  <li>Allow for chancellation of the test with a chancel button. The
result will not be stored but the test will be marked as taken.
  </li>
  <li>If immediate answer validation (aka. ad_form check) for a
question is true, check the answer if it is valid, otherwise notify the
user that it is not and do not store the result.
  </li>
</ul>
The processing has to take some additional notes into consideration:
<ul>
  <li>Branching does not always depend on an answer but may also depend
on the result within a section (branch by disctractor, median)
  </li>
  <li>questions within a section can be randomly displayed. Take also
into account that not all questions have to be displayed and that some
of the questions migt be mandatory and even mandatory in position.
  </li>
  <li>When displaying random questions the randomizing element has to
be the same for each response_id (the user shall not have the option to
see different questions just by hitting reload).
  </li>
</ul>
Once the assessment has been finished
<ul>
  <li>Display optional electronic signature file upload with an "I
certify this test and state it is mine" checkbox. This will be stored
in addition to the test.
  </li>
  <li>Notifications shall be send to the admin, staff and respondee.
  </li>
  <li>If we shall display the results to the respondee immediatly after
finishing the assessment, show it to him / her. Display the comments
along depending on the settings.
  </li>
  <li>If we have a special score, show this result to the user (e.g. if
90% means "you are a dream husband", display this along with the 90%).
  </li>
  <li>Display a link with the possibility to show all the questions and
answers for printout.
  </li>
  <li>Store the endtime with the response.
  </li>
</ul>
An administrator can take the survey in various modes which he can
select before the first section will be displayed.
<ul>
  <li>Normal mode: The adminsitrator is treated as a normal respondee,
the response will be stored in the system.
  </li>
  <li>Test mode: The administrator sees the survey as a normal
respondee, the response will not be stored in the system.
  </li>
  <li>Optional: Display correct answers when taking the assessment.</li>
</ul>
