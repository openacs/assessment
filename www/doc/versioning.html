<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This topic requires special mention because it is centrally important
to Assessment and one of the most radical departures from the current
packages (in which "surveys" or "questionnaires" are all one-shot
affairs that at best can be cloned but not readily modified in a
controlled fashion).
</p>
<p>During its lifetime, an Assessment may undergo revisions in the
midst of data collection. These revisions may be minor (change of a
label on an Item or adddition of a new Choice to an Item) or major
(addition or deletion of an entire Section). Obviously in most
applications, such changes are undesirable and people want to avoid
them. But the reality is that such changes are inevitable and so the
Assessment package must accommodate them. Clinical trial protocols
change; teachers alter their exams from term to term. And still, there
is a crucial need to be able to assemble and interpret data collected
across all these changes.
</p>
<p>Another type of "revision" occurs when a component (an Item
Choice, Item, Section, or the entire Assessment) needs to be translated
into another language. Even if the semantics of the component are
identical (and they should be or you need a better translator ;-), the
Assessment package needs to handle this situation correctly: an admin
user needs to be able to "assign" the right language version to a set
of subjects, and the returned user data need to be assembled into
trans-language data sets.
</p>
<p>Note that two orthogonal constructs are in play here:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li> Many-many relationships: a given Section may be reused in
many different Assessments (eg if it contains commonly-needed Items
such as questions about demographic details) </li>
  <li> Multiple versions: that same Section may exist in
different versions in those different Assessments (eg if different
Assessment authors add or subtract an Item, change wording of an Item's
label, etc). This includes different translations of semantically
identical text. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Approach</h2>
<p>The Content Repository (CR) in OpenACS is designed to handle these
complex design issues, though it is still undergoing refinements and
how best to use it is also still being discovered. So the ideas here
are still somewhat exploratory.
</p>
<p>For each of the package components that need to be versioned
(certainly the core components as_assessments, as_sections, as_items,
and as_item_choices; but also other components like as_policies), we
extend the basic CR entities cr_items and cr_revisions. Thus we
actually have, for instance, two tables for Items:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li> as_items (a cr_item) for whatever "immutable" attributes there
are </li>
  <li> as_items_revs (a cr_revision) for all mutable attributes
including translations </li>
</ul>
<p>
This pattern of dual tables is used for all components that need to
behave this way. When an admin user creates a new Item, a new row is
inserted into the as_items and the as_items_revs table. Then when the
same admin user (or another admin user) changes something about the
Item, a new as_items_revs row is inserted.
</p>
<p>Now here is where things become tricky, though.. Any time a
component is changed, there is a simultaneous implicit change to the
entire hierarchy.
Data collected after this change will be collected with a semantically
different instrument. Whether the difference is large or small is
immaterial; it is different, and Assessment must handle this. And the
CR doesn't do this for us automagically.
</p>
<p>So what the package must do is version both the individual
entities and also all the relationships over which we join when we're
assembling the entire Assessment (whether to send out to a requesting
user, to stuff the database when the form comes back, or to pull
collected data into a report). </p>
<p>This doesn't involve merely creating triggers to insert new mapping
table rows that point to the new components. We also need to insert new
revisions for all components higher up the hierarchy than the component
we've just revised. Thus:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li> If we change the text displayed with a Section, then we need to
insert a new as_section_revs and a new as_section_assessment_map row.
But we also need to insert a new as_assessment_revs as well, since if
the Section is different, so is the Assessment. However, we don't need
to insert any new as_item_revs for Items in the Section, though we do
need to insert new as_section_item_map rows.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li> If we change the text of an Item Choice, then we need to insert
new stuff all the way up the hierarchy. </li>
</ul>
<p>
Another key issue, discussed in <a
 href="http://openacs.org/forums/message-view?message_id=167168">this
thread</a>,
involves the semantics of versioning. How big of a modification in some
Assessment package entity needs to happen before that entity is now a
"new item" instead of a "new version of an existing item"? If a typo in
a single Item Choice is corrected, one can reasonably assume that is
merely a new version. But if an Item of multiple choice options is
given a new choice, is this Item now a new one?
</p>
<p>One possible way this could be defined would derive from the
hierarchy model in the CR: cr_items -- but not cr_revisions -- can
contain other entities; the parent_id column is only in cr_items. Thus
if we want to add a fifth as_item_choice to an as_item (while
preserving the state of the as_item that only had four
as_item_choices), we need to insert a new as_item and not merely a new
as_item_rev for the existing as_item.</p>
<p>A final point concerns the mapping tables. The OpenACS
framework provides a variety of special-purpose mapping tables that are
all proper acs_objects (member_rels, composition_rels, acs_rels, and
the CR's own cr_rels). These provide additional control over
permissioning but fundamentally are mapping tables. In the long run the
benefit of using them is the ability of OpenACS 6, to auto construct
code based on cr_item_types and relationships.<br>
</p>

<h2>Specific Versionable Entities</h2>
<p>Within each subsystem of the Assessment package, the following
entities will inherit from the CR. We list them here now, and once
we've confirmed this selection, we'll move the information out to each
of the subsystems' pages.
</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li> Core - Items:
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li> Items: as_items; as_items_revs </li>
      <li> Item Choices: as_item_choices; as_item_choices_revs </li>
      <li> Localized Items: as_item_localized; as_item_localized_revs <br>
Note:
we're not yet entirely sure what we gain by this when Items themselves
are versioned; we haven't yet settled on whether different translations
of the same Items should be different versions or not. </li>
      <li> Messages: as_messages; as_messages_revs </li>
    </ul>
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li> Core - Grouping:
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li> Assessments: as_assessments; as_assessments_revs </li>
      <li> Sections: as_sections; as_sections_revs </li>
    </ul>
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li> Scheduling:
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li> Assessment Events: as_assessment_events;
as_assessment_events_revs </li>
      <li> Assessment Policies: as_assessment_policies;
as_assessment_policies_revs </li>
    </ul>
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li> Core - Collected Data:
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li> Item Data: as_item_data; as_item_data_revs </li>

    </ul>
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li> Session Data:
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li> Sessions: as_sessions; as_sessions_revs </li>
      <li> Assessment Data: as_assessment_data; as_assessment_data_revs
      </li>
      <li> Section Data: as_section_data; as_section_data_revs </li>
